# Java-Assignment2

I was tasked with developing a RESTful web service for a hardware platform. The web service should provide endpoints for users to perform various operations such as browsing items, searching for items by name or description, and managing their cart. Additionally, administrators should have access to functionalities such as adding new items, updating item details, and generating reports.

I had to develop a Java RESTful web service using JAX-RS that fulfils the requirements mentioned above. Ensuring that the web service connects to a MySQL database to store and retrieve items information, user data, and cart. Implementing JSON processing for exchanging data between clients and the server.
